# **TechGame - Parallel Processing.**

## **Language & Modules**
Made with 100% Python and the PyQt6 module. Compiled with Pyinstaller.

## **Info**
This is the repository for my new game ```Parallel Processing```.

#### Game
Ion Drive is a game I made a long time ago, and I am remaking it from scratch.

#### Theme
(Old) You are a robot who has crash landed on an alien planet and you need to collect resources from defeated enemies to rebuild your **Ion Drive**.

(New) You are an explorer, but you have gotten lost in an ancient maze. You're only hope is to navigate the maze with your trusty compass and a strange parallel universe.

## **Status**
Under Development / Comming soon.
